# Springboard (Section 52): Algortihms and Data Structures

## Goals in this unit:
- Learn about the most important algorithms and data structures that every aspiring software engineer should know
- Get acquainted with Big O notation, a way of measuring the runtime of your algorithms
- Learn about data structures like stacks, graphs, queues, and linked lists which are ubiquitous in real-world development.

## Topics covered
1. **Algorithms**: Understand the core algorithms that are essential for efficient problem-solving.
2. **Big O Notation**: Learn how to analyze and measure the performance of your algorithms
3. **Data Structures**: 
	- Stacks: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure used in many scenarios
	- Graphs: Data structures used to model pairwise relations between objects
	- Queues: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure essential for handling tasks in order
	- Linked Lists: Data structures that consist of nodes where each node contains a data part and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
